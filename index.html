		        <p id="p">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three core technologies used to build websites. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the basic structure of a webpage by defining elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and design the webpage, controlling colors, layout, fonts, and overall appearance to make the page visually appealing. JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior, allowing webpages to respond to user actions—such as clicking a button, displaying pop-ups, or updating content without reloading. Together, these three technologies work as the foundation for creating modern, responsive, and interactive web experiences.</p>

		        <p id="p">PHP and SQL are powerful technologies used to build dynamic and data-driven websites. PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language that processes user requests, handles form data, manages sessions, and connects web pages with databases. SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to store, retrieve, update, and manage data inside a database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. When used together, PHP executes the logic of a web application while SQL manages the data it needs—allowing websites to handle user accounts, display stored information, save user inputs, and perform many other dynamic functions essential for modern web applications.</p>
